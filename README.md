# [Project 1 Overview: The trending topics in Machine Learning : View project source code on Github](https://github.com/rajinipreethajohn/The-Trending-Topics-in-Machine-Learning)

<ins>Project Desciption:</ins> Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) is one of the top machine learning conferences in the world where groundbreaking work is published. In this Project, I have analyzed a large collection of NIPS research papers from (1987 to 2017) to discover the latest trends in machine learning.

<ins>Technology:</ins> Python

<ins>Tools and techniques used:</ins> **Pandas library, Natural Language Processing (NPL) from sklearn library**

<ins>Project tasks:</ins>
  *Loading the NIPS papers
  *Preparing the data for analysis
  *Plotting how machine learning has evolved over time
  *Preprocessing the text data
  *A word cloud to visualize the preprocessed text data
  *Prepare the text for Latent Dirichlet allocation- LDA analysis
  *Analysing trends with LDA
  *The future of machine learning

<ins>Topics:</ins>  **1.Data Manipulation 2.Data Visualization 3.Machine Learning 4.Probability & Statistics 5.Importing & Cleaning Data**

# [Project 2: Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office : View project source code on Github](https://github.com/rajinipreethajohn/Netflix)

Project Overview: Netflix! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into the largest entertainment/media company by market capitalization, boasting over 200 million subscribers as of January 2021.

Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a perfect opportunity to flex our data manipulation skills and dive into the entertainment industry.  For their first order of business, they have been performing some analyses, and they believe that the average duration of movies has been declining.

As evidence of this, they have provided us with the following information. For the years from 2011 to 2020, the average movie durations are 103, 101, 99, 100, 100, 95, 95, 96, 93, and 90, respectively.

A good place to start would be to start working with pandas! Let's dive right in!

# [Project 3: The Android app market on Google Play : View project source code on Github](https://github.com/rajinipreethajohn/Android-App-Market)

Project Overview: Mobile apps are everywhere. They are easy to create and can be lucrative. Because of these two factors, more and more apps are being developed. In this notebook, we will do a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories. We'll look for insights in the data to devise.

# [Project 4: The GitHub History of the Scala Language : View project source code on Github](https://github.com/rajinipreethajohn/Scala-Language)

Project Overview: With almost 30k commits and a history spanning over ten years, Scala is a mature programming language. It is a general-purpose programming language that has recently become another prominent language for data scientists.

Scala is also an open source project. Open source projects have the advantage that their entire development histories -- who made changes, what was changed, code reviews, etc. -- are publicly available.

We're going to read in, clean up, and visualize the real world project repository of Scala that spans data from a version control system (Git) as well as a project hosting site (GitHub). We will find out who has had the most influence on its development and who are the experts.

The dataset we will use, which has been previously mined and extracted from GitHub, is comprised of three files:

pulls_2011-2013.csv contains the basic information about the pull requests, and spans from the end of 2011 up to (but not including) 2014. pulls_2014-2018.csv contains identical information, and spans from 2014 up to 2018. pull_files.csv contains the files that were modified by each pull request.

# [Project 5: A Visual History of Nobel Prize Winners : View project source code on Github](https://github.com/rajinipreethajohn/Nobel-Prize-Winners)

Project Overview: The Nobel Prize is perhaps the world's most well known scientific award. Every year it's given to scientists and scholars in the categories chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics, and peace. The first Nobel Prize was handed out in 1901, and at that time the Prize was very Eurocentric and male-focused, but nowadays it's not biased in any way whatsoever. Surely. Right? Let's dive in!
